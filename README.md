# 🎵 Simple Music Player

A full-featured Spotify-inspired music player built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 

 Made while learning web development to understand DOM manipulation, file handling, and UI responsiveness.

Songs are organized in folders inside a `SONGS/` directory, and albums are dynamically loaded with metadata. The player is fully responsive and includes song library for each album, seekbar and volume controls.

>_This project excludes actual copyrighted songs, instead non-copyrighted tracks are added._
